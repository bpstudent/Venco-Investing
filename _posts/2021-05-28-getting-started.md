How To Start Retail Trading 101

The easiest and fastest way to start retail trading is through using a mobile phone and a mobile trading application. Some of these come with desktop services also while others do not. Below is a list of exchanges that we use and recommend.

Degiro [Degiro](https://www.degiro.co.uk/member-get-member/start-trading?id=E130DFA9&amp;utm_source=mgm)


How to open a retail trading account 

Opening an account is fairly simple. You will need a form of identification, a passport or driver's license is the norm. A bank account and a mobile phone with internet. 

Each of the three exchange providers are slightly different and have different benefits that when used together lead to a winning portfolio.

Trading 212 allows for pre market trading and is the best one that we know of which does this for people based in the UK

Revolut has a good amount of commission free trades, but is also a bank account that comes with various other benefits. It also has access to other assets such as gold and crypto  currencies. 

Degiro has a very comprehensive number of assets to choose to invest in and is complemented by a great mobile or desktop application user interface.


Wetting your feet

We highly recommend only using money you are willing to lose while you are investing. If you use money that you rely on you will find it hard to detach your emotions from your investments and are more likely to make silly decisions. You can read more about that in this blog [https://vencoinvesting.me/Trading-Psychology/](https://vencoinvesting.me/Trading-Psychology/)

There are various trading exchanges that offer a gaming account. Gaming accounts can be a good way of practicing what you are learning before risking real money. If you can be consistent with a gaming account it's a good sign that you’re ready for a real account. 

The gaming accounts we recommend are listed below:
