Starting trading as a novice can be a daunting concept, and it is made more intimidating by worrying about what is happening or what you will do next. Managing your mindset and evolving it into a strong trading one is key to taking a novice investor and making them feel comfortable enough to trade independently without having a total meltdown. There are 4 main emotions that you can feel when investing, the key when starting out is to recognise when you are succumbing to them and learn how to manage them. 

* Euphoria - when you have success and see your investment rise both continuously and or rapidly.
* Fear - when you see your investments losing money and your portfolio going into or deeper into a loss.
* Greed - when your investments rise a significant amount and you stay in to hold out for further unrealistic returns.
* Revenge - when you lose money on an investment so make a further uneducated investment to try to recoup losses.

How you react to these can show the gaps in trading knowledge. What is important is that if you feel you are succumbing to one of the above emotions you step away and donâ€™t make any investment decisions. Trading on emotion is a big no-no and trading 101 is to not do it whatsoever.

In our experience managing these emotions is easier than it might seem, education and experience. 

Educating yourselves is vital to controlling your emotions. This can be the difference between holding on to a stock that is getting pumped and losing all your gains and even going past your entry into a loss or getting out right at the top and making serious profits. This is what many people did with the short squeeze on Gamestop (GME). Education is often better than experience. We say this because more often than not the experiences that you learn from are the ones where you have lost money. Always favour educational learning over learning experiences.

Being organised can also help you manage your emotions and develop a strong financially focused mindset. We find that the best way to do this is to have a good routine that you follow each day in the premarket before trading starts. By doing this you will get a good understanding of how the markets are performing, which will let you understand how your stocks are reacting to the market conditions on any specific day. Of course, your routine will vary depending on your trading style. For instance, a day trader might look for possible entry points each day from candlestick patterns, while a value investor might spend the morning looking for undervalued firms via net present value calculations. 


Here is our general routine that we follow that allows us to keep confidence in our investment portfolio:
* Conduct a market overview (CNBC or Market Watch but there are many various free sources that give great markets overviews)
* Check existing positions
* Locate potential trades (methods depend on trading philosophy/strategy)
* Design a watch list (what is the opportunity, Entry point, exit point, stop-loss point)

There is no one size fits all routine as it will change per person and investment philosophy, but we find that the above is a good place to start.

When beginning your investment journey it will seem like you climbing Everest, be remember everyone started at the beginning. Here are a few things to keep in mind when beginning your journey.
